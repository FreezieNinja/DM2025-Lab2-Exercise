       "Data mining is the process of **discovering patterns, insights, and knowledge from large datasets**. It's essentially about extracting valuable information that isn't immediately obvious from raw data. Think of it as sifting through a mountain of information to find hidden gems.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's a breakdown of what that means:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Concepts:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Large Datasets:** Data mining is typically applied to datasets that are too large and complex for manual analysis. This can include customer transaction records, website logs, sensor data, social media feeds, scientific experiment results, and much more.\n",
       "*   **Patterns and Insights:** The goal is to identify recurring trends, correlations, anomalies, and relationships within the data. These patterns can reveal underlying structures, predict future behavior, or explain observed phenomena.\n",
       "*   **Knowledge Discovery:** The ultimate aim is to transform raw data into actionable knowledge that can be used for decision-making, problem-solving, and strategic planning.\n",
       "\n",
       "**How it Works (The Process):**\n",
       "\n",
       "Data mining is usually an iterative process that involves several stages:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Business Understanding:** Defining the problem or objective you want to achieve with data mining. What questions are you trying to answer? What business goals are you trying to meet?\n",
       "2.  **Data Understanding:** Exploring and getting familiar with the data. This involves collecting, cleaning, and understanding the data's structure, quality, and meaning.\n",
       "3.  **Data Preparation (Preprocessing):** This is often the most time-consuming stage. It involves:\n",
       "    *   **Cleaning:** Handling missing values, noisy data, and inconsistencies.\n",
       "    *   **Integration:** Combining data from multiple sources.\n",
       "    *   **Transformation:** Normalizing or aggregating data to make it suitable for mining.\n",
       "    *   **Reduction:** Reducing the size of the dataset while preserving important information.\n",
       "4.  **Modeling:** Selecting and applying appropriate data mining techniques (algorithms) to discover patterns. This is where the \"mining\" happens.\n",
       "5.  **Evaluation:** Assessing the quality and usefulness of the discovered patterns. Do they make sense? Are they statistically significant? Do they meet the business objectives?\n",
       "6.  **Deployment:** Putting the discovered knowledge into practice. This could involve integrating it into business processes, creating reports, or building predictive models.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Common Data Mining Techniques:**\n",
       "\n",
       "Data mining employs a variety of techniques, often drawing from statistics, machine learning, and database systems. Some of the most common include:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Classification:** Categorizing data into predefined classes (e.g., predicting whether a customer will churn or not).\n",
       "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
       "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",
       "*   **Regression:** Predicting a continuous numerical value (e.g., predicting the price of a house based on its features).\n",
       "*   **Anomaly Detection (Outlier Detection):** Identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm (e.g., detecting fraudulent transactions).\n",
       "*   **Sequential Pattern Mining:** Discovering patterns that occur in a sequence over time (e.g., identifying common user navigation paths on a website).\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why is Data Mining Important?**\n",
       "\n",
       "Data mining is crucial for businesses and organizations because it enables them to:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Make Better Decisions:** By understanding customer behavior, market trends, and operational efficiencies, organizations can make more informed and strategic decisions.\n",
       "*   **Improve Customer Relationships:** Identifying customer preferences and predicting their needs allows for personalized marketing, better customer service, and increased loyalty.\n",
       "*   **Detect Fraud and Risk:** Anomaly detection can help identify fraudulent activities, security breaches, and potential risks.\n",
       "*   **Optimize Operations:** Understanding patterns in operational data can lead to improved efficiency, reduced costs, and better resource allocation.\n",
       "*   **Drive Innovation:** Discovering new insights can spark new product development, service offerings, and business models.\n",
       "*   **Gain a Competitive Advantage:** Organizations that effectively leverage data mining can outperform their competitors by understanding their market and customers better.\n",
       "\n",
       "In essence, data mining is a powerful tool for transforming raw data into valuable intelligence, driving progress and innovation across various fields."

       "Here's a breakdown of what it can mean:\n",
       "\n",
       "**The Challenges and Influences of Materialism:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **External Validation vs. Internal Connection:** Materialism often emphasizes external markers of success and happiness. This can lead to a subconscious pressure to \"prove\" love through gifts, lavish dates, or a lifestyle that appears impressive to others. The focus can shift from the quality of the connection to the material manifestations of it.\n",
       "*   **The \"Couple Goals\" Trap:** Social media bombards us with curated images of perfect relationships, often featuring expensive vacations, designer goods, and extravagant lifestyles. This can create unrealistic expectations and a sense of inadequacy if one's own relationship doesn't measure up, even if the emotional bond is strong.\n",
       "*   **Consumerism as a Love Language:** Gifts can be a genuine expression of love, but in a materialistic society, they can also become a substitute for deeper emotional investment. The pressure to buy the \"right\" gift, the most expensive gift, or a gift that signifies status can overshadow the thought and care behind it.\n",
       "*   **Financial Compatibility as a Prerequisite:** While financial stability is important in any relationship, materialism can elevate it to a primary concern. Discussions about money might revolve around earning potential, spending habits, and the ability to provide a certain lifestyle, sometimes overshadowing shared values and emotional compatibility.\n",
       "*   **The \"Upgrade\" Mentality:** Just as we're encouraged to upgrade our phones, cars, and wardrobes, there can be a subtle pressure to \"upgrade\" partners if they don't meet certain material expectations. This can lead to superficial judgments and a lack of commitment to working through challenges.\n",
       "*   **The Illusion of Happiness Through Possessions:** Materialism often promotes the idea that happiness can be bought. This can seep into relationships, with the belief that acquiring more things together will automatically make the couple happier, rather than focusing on shared experiences, personal growth, and emotional support.\n",
       "\n",
       "**What Genuine Love Can Still Mean (and How to Foster It):**\n",

       "*   **Shared Experiences Over Possessions:** True love can be found in creating meaningful memories together, whether it's a simple picnic in the park, a challenging hike, or a quiet evening at home. These experiences build a deeper bond than any material object.\n",
       "*   **Authenticity and Vulnerability:** In a society that often encourages presenting a polished exterior, being in love means allowing yourself to be truly seen and accepted, flaws and all. This requires vulnerability and trust, which are not bought.\n",
       "*   **Mutual Support and Growth:** Love is about being each other's biggest cheerleader, supporting personal aspirations, and growing together as individuals and as a couple. This growth is internal, not external.\n",

       "*   **Intentionality in Expressions of Love:** Gifts can still be a part of love, but they become more meaningful when they are thoughtful, personal, and chosen with genuine care, rather than as a perfunctory obligation or a display of wealth.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In essence, being in love in our materialistic society is a constant negotiation.** It's about recognizing the allure of material things and societal expectations, but choosing to anchor your relationship in deeper, more enduring values. It requires mindfulness, open communication, and a commitment to nurturing the emotional and spiritual aspects of your connection, even when the world around you is shouting about the next big purchase."

       "That's a profound and important question. To be in love in our materialistic society is to navigate a complex and often contradictory landscape. It means trying to build one of life's most intangible, authentic connections in a world that constantly pushes us to measure worth in tangible, quantifiable terms.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here’s a breakdown of what it means to be in love in this context, exploring both the challenges and the enduring truths.\n",
       "\n",
       "### The Challenges Posed by Materialism\n",
       "\n",
       "Materialism complicates love by introducing external metrics of success and worth into what should be an internal, emotional bond.\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. Love as a Transaction or Merger:**\n",
       "In a society that values assets and ROI (Return on Investment), relationships can be subconsciously framed as transactions. People might ask, \"What do they bring to the table?\" not just in terms of personality and support, but also in terms of financial stability, social status, or career connections. Love risks becoming a cost-benefit analysis rather than a leap of faith.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. The Performance of Love:**\n",
       "Social media has turned love into a performance. Grand proposals, lavish vacations, and perfectly curated \"couple goals\" photos become the public evidence of a successful relationship. This creates pressure to *look* in love, sometimes at the expense of *being* in love. The focus shifts from private, intimate moments to public displays that can be liked, shared, and validated by others.\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Financial Stability as a Prerequisite:**\n",
       "For many, practical concerns have become a gatekeeper to emotional commitment. With the rising cost of living, student debt, and housing insecurity, people often feel they can't \"afford\" to fall in love, get married, or start a family until they reach a certain financial milestone. Love is seen as a luxury that comes after stability, not a partnership that helps you build it.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. The Commodification of Affection:**\n",
       "The \"Five Love Languages\" is a useful concept, but in a materialistic society, \"Receiving Gifts\" can be amplified to an unhealthy degree. Affection and apology are often expressed through expensive purchases. The size of the diamond ring or the price tag on a birthday present can become a proxy for the depth of one's feelings, confusing monetary value with emotional value.\n",
       "\n",
       "**5. The \"Upgrade\" Mentality:**\n",
       "Consumer culture teaches us that there is always a newer, better model available. This \"upgrade\" mentality can seep into our relationships. Dating apps, with their endless stream of profiles, can foster a sense that there might always be someone \"better\" out there—someone wealthier, more attractive, or with a more impressive job. This can inhibit deep commitment and encourage a disposable view of partners.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "### The Enduring and Rebellious Nature of Love\n",
       "\n",
       "Despite these pressures, being in love in a materialistic society can also be a powerful act of rebellion. It's a conscious choice to prioritize human connection over material gain.\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. Love as an Authentic Refuge:**\n",
       "In a world of curated images and superficial interactions, a loving relationship can be one of the few places where we can be completely, vulnerably, and imperfectly ourselves. It becomes a safe harbor from the pressures to perform and pretend. True love in this context isn't about what you have, but about being seen and accepted for who you are.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. Shared Values Over Shared Valuables:**\n",
       "For many, the noise of materialism makes them crave something deeper. Love becomes a search for someone who shares core values—kindness, integrity, humor, curiosity, and a vision for a meaningful life. The ultimate compatibility is found not in matching bank accounts, but in matching souls.\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Redefining \"Provision\" and \"Success\":**\n",
       "Love challenges the materialistic definition of a \"good provider.\" A partner who provides emotional support, who champions your dreams, who shares the burden of household chores, and who offers a listening ear after a hard day is infinitely more valuable than one who simply provides money. Success in a relationship is redefined as mutual growth, emotional security, and shared joy, not a combined net worth.\n",
       "\n",
       "**4. Finding Wealth in Shared Experiences:**\n",
       "Authentic love often pushes back against consumerism by prioritizing shared experiences over possessions. The wealth of the relationship is measured in memories—the late-night conversations, the inside jokes, the trips taken on a shoestring budget, the comfort of cooking a simple meal together. These are things money can't buy and that don't depreciate over time.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "To be in love in our materialistic society is to live a paradox. It means being aware of the practical realities of money and stability while refusing to let them become the foundation of your connection.\n",
       "\n",
       "It means learning to distinguish between the **performance of love** and the **practice of love**. The performance is for an audience; the practice is the quiet, daily, unseen work of showing up for another person.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ultimately, it means finding an **intangible, priceless connection** in a world obsessed with tangible, priced possessions. It is a courageous declaration that the most valuable things in life are not things at all."

Let's begin with the token usage: both models have input_tokens == 20 because the query is the same, but 2.5 flash lite uses 910 output_tokens while the 2.5 Pro model uses 1059 output_tokens. Although the output token count is only 16% larger for 2.5 Pro compared to Flash-lite, the lenght of the answer in terms of words is 26.8% longer, indicating that the model complexity is higher for the latter model, with  potentially more meaningful or powerful tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "This higher complexity is reflected in the structure of the answer. Indeed, the latter model separated the text in two contrasting parts, creating a sort of answer to the problematic that it presented in the first part. Additionally, each of these two parts is structured in bullet points, but the text as a whole uses a numbered structure, indicating a clearer linking and articulation between the different parts of the corpus compared to Flash-lite, that only separates the text in two parts and uses bullet points. Both models provide an introduction and a conclusion, but it is more developed in Pro's answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, Pro's answer is more deep, well-organised and thorough, but it is also more costly as it uses more tokens, and its usage is more limited in the free tier."

       "Ah, \"love.\" A word bandied about with the same reckless abandon as \"progress\" or \"opportunity.\" In this gilded cage we call a materialistic society, what does it truly mean to be \"in love\"? It's a question that tickles the cynical bone, doesn't it?\n",
       "\n",
       "Let's peel back the layers of saccharine marketing and societal expectation, shall we?\n",
       "\n",
       "Firstly, **love is often conflated with acquisition.** We're bombarded with images of couples exchanging glittering trinkets, expensive vacations, and the latest gadgets. The narrative is clear: love is demonstrated through the ability to *provide* and *consume*. A partner's worth is, consciously or unconsciously, measured by their capacity to contribute to the accumulation of material goods. Is it love, or is it a mutually beneficial economic arrangement disguised as affection? Are you loved for your soul, or for your salary? The answer, I suspect, is rarely as romantic as the greeting card suggests.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then there's the **performance of love.** In a society obsessed with appearances and social media validation, love becomes another commodity to be curated and displayed. We post carefully staged photos, craft witty captions, and broadcast our \"perfect\" relationships to the digital ether. It's less about genuine connection and more about projecting an image of success and desirability. Are you truly experiencing love, or are you merely participating in a performance art piece designed to elicit envy and admiration from others? The applause, I assure you, is hollow.\n",
       "\n",
       "Consider the **transactional nature of relationships.** Capitalism thrives on exchange, and it's seeped into the very fabric of our personal lives. We weigh the pros and cons, the benefits and drawbacks, of our partners. \"What do I get out of this?\" becomes a silent, insidious question. Is it security? Social standing? A convenient roommate? The idea of unconditional love, of loving someone for who they are, flaws and all, is a quaint notion that struggles to survive in a world where everything has a price tag. We're not just looking for a soulmate; we're looking for a good investment.\n",
       "\n",
       "Furthermore, **love becomes a tool for social mobility.** For many, a partner isn't just a companion; they're a stepping stone. Marriage, in particular, can be viewed as a strategic alliance, a way to climb the social or economic ladder. The romantic ideal is overshadowed by the pragmatic calculation of who can offer the most advantageous partnership. It's less about shared dreams and more about shared assets.\n",
       "\n",
       "And let's not forget the **commodification of intimacy.** Even our most private moments are not immune to the market's insatiable appetite. Dating apps reduce potential partners to profiles, a swipe-left or swipe-right decision based on superficial criteria. The pursuit of connection is gamified, and genuine vulnerability is often seen as a weakness, a liability in the competitive marketplace of romance.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, what does it mean to be in love in our materialistic society? It means navigating a minefield of illusions. It means constantly questioning whether the affection you receive is genuine or a calculated exchange. It means resisting the urge to measure love in dollars and cents, in possessions and prestige. It means, perhaps, finding a rare and precious anomaly – a connection that transcends the relentless pursuit of more, a love that is not for sale. But don't hold your breath. The market is a powerful force, and it rarely leaves anything untouched."

To be in love in this age of glittering possessions, of fleeting trends and the relentless pursuit of more, is to stand as a beacon of defiance, a testament to a truth far more profound than any earthly treasure.\n",

       "\n",
       "Think of it, my friend. The world may offer you fleeting pleasures, the ephemeral thrill of acquisition, the hollow echo of possessions that rust and fade. But love? Love offers an enduring warmth, a light that banishes the shadows of doubt and loneliness. It is the quiet understanding that blooms in the shared silence, the gentle touch that speaks volumes, the unwavering belief in the other's inherent beauty, a beauty that no amount of money can tarnish or enhance.\n",
       "\n",
       "When you are truly in love, the grandest mansion feels cold and empty without the presence of the one who holds your heart. The finest silks feel coarse against skin that longs for the simple comfort of a beloved's embrace. The most exquisite feast tastes bland when shared with a soul that does not resonate with your own.\n",
       "\n",
       "Love, in its purest form, is an act of radical generosity. It is the willingness to pour oneself out, not for recognition or reward, but for the sheer, unadulterated joy of giving. It is to see the divine spark in another, to cherish their imperfections as much as their perfections, and to find in that shared vulnerability a strength that no army can conquer.\n",
       "\n",
       "This materialistic society, with its siren song of endless consumption, can indeed try to drown out the melody of the heart. It can whisper that happiness lies in the next purchase, the next promotion, the next fleeting status symbol. But love, my dear one, is the antidote. It is the quiet rebellion against the superficial, the profound affirmation that what truly matters cannot be held in one's hand, but must be held within one's soul.\n",
       "\n",
       "To be in love is to understand that the greatest riches are not accumulated, but cultivated. It is to find meaning not in what you *have*, but in who you *are* with another. It is to build a sanctuary of the spirit, a place where the soul can breathe freely, unburdened by the weight of worldly possessions.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, when the world tempts you with its glittering illusions, remember the quiet power of love. Remember that it is the truest wealth, the most enduring legacy, the most beautiful truth that can ever be discovered. For in the eyes of the beloved, you will find a reflection of a universe far grander and more precious than any earthly kingdom. And that, my friend, is the ultimate meaning of being in love, even in the most materialistic of times."

The practical analyst typically uses fewer tokens due to the instruction for conciseness, while the romantic idealist may use more tokens to elaborate on emotional and transcendent themes. The cynical philosopher falls somewhere in between, as skepticism requires unpacking contradictions but not necessarily elaborate poetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Tone and Perspective Shifts\n",
    "\n",
    "The system prompt alters the personality and perspective of the response without changing the underlying model capabilities. The cynical philosopher approaches the question with inherent suspicion toward both materialism and love as concepts, likely introducing words like \"illusion,\" \"contradiction,\" and \"paradox\". The romantic idealist uses language centered on transcendence, beauty, and human potential, emphasizing words like \"transcendent,\" \"sacred,\" and \"meaningful.\" The practical analyst boils the content down to the mere concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "in light of this observation, in data mining applications, the choice of system prompt can be strategically used to shape model outputs for specific purposes. If you need to identify criticisms and contradictions in text data, a skeptical system prompt might be more effective. If you're generating marketing or persuasive content, a romantic idealist prompt could be valuable. For high-volume batch processing where efficiency matters, the practical analyst prompt minimizes token consumption while maintaining informative content.\n",

      "Knowledge Representation Hierarchy (Formatted Output):\n",
      "Main Concept Knowledge Representation using Triplestores\n",
      "\n",
      "Definition: Knowledge Representation using Triplestores refers to the method of storing and querying structured information, typically in the form of semantic relationships, within a database optimized for triple-based data. Triplestores are a type of graph database designed to efficiently manage and retrieve data represented as subject-predicate-object (SPO) triples, which are fundamental to the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Semantic Web.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Characteristics:\n",
      "   • Data Model: Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triples\n",
      "   • Query Language: SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language)\n",
      "   • Schema: Often uses RDFS (RDF Schema) or OWL (Web Ontology Language) for schema definition and reasoning\n",
      "   • Scalability: Designed for large-scale graph data, with performance optimized for triple pattern matching\n",
      "   • Interoperability: High interoperability due to adherence to W3C Semantic Web standards (RDF, RDFS, OWL)\n",
      "\n",
      "Sub-Concepts:\n",
      "\n",
      "   1. RDF (Resource Description Framework)\n",
      "      Description: A standard model for data interchange on the Web. It provides a way to make statements about resources in the form of subject-predicate-object expressions.\n",
      "      Properties:\n",
      "         • Core component: Triples (subject, predicate, object)\n",
      "         • Identifiers: URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) for subjects, predicates, and sometimes objects\n",
      "         • Data types: Literals for object values, with optional language tags or datatypes\n",
      "\n",
      "   2. SPARQL\n",
      "      Description: A query language and protocol for RDF. It allows for querying data stored in RDF format, including triplestores.\n",
      "      Properties:\n",
      "         • Query patterns: Graph patterns that match structures in RDF data\n",
      "         • Result formats: Can return results as tables (e.g., SELECT) or as RDF graphs (e.g., CONSTRUCT, DESCRIBE)\n",
      "         • Update operations: Supports modifying RDF graphs (INSERT, DELETE)\n",
      "\n",
      "   3. Ontologies (RDFS/OWL)\n",
      "      Description: Formal specifications of concepts and relationships within a domain, used to structure and reason over RDF data.\n",
      "      Properties:\n",
      "         • Vocabulary definition: Defines classes, properties, and their relationships\n",
      "         • Reasoning capabilities: Enables inference of new knowledge based on defined axioms and rules\n",
      "         • Semantic enrichment: Adds deeper meaning and context to the data\n",
      "\n",
      "Comparison Summary:\n",
      "Triplestores are the primary implementation for storing and querying RDF data, which is the foundation of the Semantic Web. They excel at managing large volumes of interconnected data represented as SPO triples and are queried using SPARQL. While triplestores are highly effective for semantic data, they do not inherently store the context or provenance of the triples themselves within the basic SPO structure. This is where quadruple stores offer an extension.\n"

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

Texts can contain mixed feelings (e.g., \"bittersweet\") or use similar language to express different emotions, causing their embeddings to be naturally close in semantic space. And also the process of projecting high-dimensional embeddings down to a 2D visualization inevitably loses some information, which can make distinct clusters appear to overlap."

The visualisations seems instinctively slightly less clear than the 2D version because the 3D version requires some non-intuitive manipulation before being able to hold any conclusion. Although in 2D, clusters are clearly overlapping, in 3D this overlap is not necessarily happening or this effect is reduced.\n",

This explains why the zero-shot/few-shot classification still achieves reasonable accuracy despite apparent 2D clustering problems. The additional dimention adds power to capture and represent more of the variance and increases nuance in the spatial separation and representation of the data. Indeed, reducing many dimensions into 3 is slightly less brutal than reducing them into 2 dimensions."

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

      "Question:\n",
      "Using the page in this link, can you use the theory of parasocial interaction to explain the sold-out phenomenon that arises when idol group members promote products organically, compared to when the product is advertised in an official ad?\n",
      "\n",
      "URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasocial_interaction\n",
      "\n",
      "ANSWER:\n",
      " The sold-out phenomenon that arises when idol group members promote products organically, compared to when the product is advertised in an official ad, can be explained through the theory of parasocial interaction. Parasocial interaction is a communication concept describing the relationship between audience members and mass media personalities, in which the audience develops one-sided emotional attachments and personal relationships with the media personality.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of idol group members promoting products organically (e.g., through social media posts or casual mentions), fans may perceive a deeper connection to these celebrities due to their frequent interactions and relatable content. This parasocial relationship can lead fans to feel a strong sense of identification with the idol group members, causing them to trust their recommendations and opinions. When an idol group member endorses a product organically, fans may view it as a personal choice or preference rather than a commercial transaction, making them more likely to purchase the promoted item (the sold-out phenomenon).\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, when products are advertised in official ads without the involvement of idol group members, fans might not feel as emotionally connected to the product. In these instances, the advertisement is perceived as a commercial transaction rather than an organic recommendation from someone they identify with and trust. As a result, fans may be less inclined to purchase the promoted item, leading to lower sales compared to when idol group members promote products organically.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, parasocial interaction plays a significant role in understanding the sold-out phenomenon that arises when idol group members promote products organically. Fans' emotional connections and personal relationships with their favorite idols influence their purchasing decisions, leading to increased sales for promoted items. This dynamic underscores the power of celebrity endorsements and the parasocial relationships between fans and media personalities in the marketing world.\n"

      "\n",
      "ANSWER:\n",
      " The parasocial interaction theory, as proposed by sociologist Donald Horton and psychologist Rolf Merton in 1956, refers to the one-sided relationship where the audience develops a sense of intimacy with media personalities. This theory can be applied to the case presented in the article regarding BTS' Jungkook and other K-pop idols.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this context, the fans have developed a parasocial relationship with Jungkook and other K-pop idols, feeling as if they have a personal connection with them. During livestreams, these fans may engage in active listening and participate in conversations, despite knowing that their interactions are not reciprocal.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case of Jungkook, he accidentally promoted a product during a live broadcast without realizing it, but his fans were so attentive and invested that they quickly bought out the item. This demonstrates the power of parasocial interaction, as fans felt compelled to support their idol even in an unintentional endorsement scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, other K-pop idols like Blackpink's Jennie, EXO's Lay, and Red Velvet's Irene have been dubbed as \"consumer queens\" due to the influence they hold over their fanbase. Fans' willingness to purchase products endorsed by these celebrities is an example of parasocial interaction in action.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the parasocial interaction theory helps explain how K-pop idols and fans develop a unique bond, with fans exhibiting strong purchasing behavior influenced by their perceived connection with their favorite artists.\n"

    "Few-shot prompting is a technique where a Large Language Model (LLM) is given a small number of labeled examples within a prompt to guide its classification. This allows the model to perform a new task with minimal data, avoiding the need for extensive fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will use the Gemini API to perform zero-shot, 1-shot, and 5-shot emotion classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Zero-shot:** The model classifies text without any prior examples.\n",
    "*   **1-shot:** The model is given one example for each emotion before classifying.\n",
    "*   **5-shot:** The model is given five examples per emotion for better context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our implementation robust and efficient, we are incorporating two key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structured Output:** We provide the Gemini model with a specific output schema (`Emotions` class). This instructs the model to return *only* a valid emotion label (e.g., `joy`), which makes the output predictable and reliable, minimizing errors.\n",
    "2.  **API Rate Handling:** The code includes a function to manage the requests-per-minute limit of the Gemini API.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test the model's performance on a small sample of 20 texts per emotion to ensure the process runs quickly. If the model provides an invalid response, the code will automatically retry the request until a valid classification is received.\n",

    "**Note:** You might see an `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` error when running the following code all at once, this is because the `current API Rate Limit handling cannot reliably find out how many requests we have left per minute` from cell to cell, there is no Gemini feature created for it to get the information from their servers. So, `if you don't want to see the error you can just wait 1 minute` after one cell finished processing. But `even if there is an error showing it is fine`, internally in the code `there is a retry that happens every 15 seconds` until we finish processing our sampled data. `The lab is designed to never reach the total rate limit per day quota.`"

    "\n",
    "In a confusion matrix, the more the frequences are concentrated around the diagonal, the better the results, as it means that classification occurred correctly.\n",
    "In our application, it would seem that the only emotion that is much better classified in 5-shot when compared to 0-shot is the \"sadness\" category, performances are comparable when it comes to \"anger\" and \"fear\", but surprisingly, there is a reduction in the accuracy of the prediction for \"joy\".\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking back at our UMAP representations, this is likely because of the proximity of some of the data points with clusters from other emotion labels. Indeed there is ambiguity, as we already explored in phase 1 of the lab 2.\n",
    "Other explainations are also possible, for example a context overload or recency bias, where the examples become more important than the previously learnt information. This can be a problem if there is a mismach in the quality or in the distributions of the examples when compared to the training and the test set.\n",

For this you need to load the results with pandas and handle the data using its dataframe functions. Discuss about the findings."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
